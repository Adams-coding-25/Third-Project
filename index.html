          <p id="text" class="weight">The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed only transfered from one form to another.
             In terms of body weight, food that you eat is turned into energy for the body, this energy cannot magically disapear.<br><br>
             In simple terms body weight is a battle between the calories consumed and calories burned. <br><br> Sadly in todays world companys like to sell fitness type 
             products that make loosing weight "easy" like the recent ozempic faze that happend in america which has side effects like organ faliurer. Any magical, too good 
             to be true solutions should be avoided. Stick to the basics, allthough it can be hard for many, your body will thank you. <b>The slower you loose weight the 
                more likely you are to keep it off for good.</b></p>

          <p id="text" class="genetics">Genetics do play a large role in your body composition, some people were born to be fatter, skinnier, muscular and everything in between.
             You are allowed to be jealous of others but you cannot change your genes. You can however focus on yourself, to become a better version.<br><br>Many of us simply 
             have a lower metabolism than others, this comes to genetics, age and hormones. Your calorie ballance is still the key to weight gain or loss, its just harder 
             for those who burn less calories naturally to loose weight. If your calories consumed < calories burned, you will loose weight although sometime it doesnt feel 
             like its working.</p></p>

        <section id="Resistance_Training" class="main-section">
          <header id="first">Resistance Training:</header>
          <p id="text" class="resistance"> Firstly, its not all bad news. For those of us who are naturally bigger, your likely also naturally stronger. 
            It is easier to put on muscle with these sort of genetics, especially if you have some "spare calories" also known as fat. Having greater muscle mass will increase your 
            metabolic rate, which will slowly help you burn fat over time. Consistancy is key and weight lifting easier and doesnt need to be done as frequently as cardiovascular 
            training does if you want to loose weight.<br><br>Training in this way too loose fat is a longer term statergy. But its also well known that the slower the weight comes
             off the more likely you are too keep it off for good. Starting by resistance training once or twice a week is enough to get the wheels turning, starting you on your way 
             to loosing fat and gaining muscle.<br><br>Resistance training does not need to be heavy, in fact, beginning with light weight for many reps is recomended. An easy way to 
             start is chose between 2-4 exersices and perform between 12-20 reps in each set, 2-4 sets of each exersice. Starting from the lower side of those exercies and sets and the 
             higher range of reps.</p>

        <section id="Walking" class="main-section">
          <header id="first">Walking:</header>
          <p id="text" class="walking"> People typically severly over-estimate how many calories you might burn performing cardiovascular exersice, in general cardiovasular 
            exersice should be performed for cardiovascular health or enjoyment, not loosing weight. There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, once you stop regularly
             performing cardio, the weight will slowly come back. Secondly, it can be very hard for larger people and put great stress on the body. Running at 100kg body 
             weight, whilst not being used to it will hurt the next day. Lastly, walking although taking longer can burn just as many calories without the hard work.<br><br>
             <b>Walking 5k burns almost the same ammount of calories as running it.</b> Do with that information as you wish. I personally would rather go for a 45 minute walk
              each day than a 20 minute run, not only for motivation and consistancy but also to avoid the strain on my knees as a heavier person.</p>

          <header id="first">Changes To Diet:</header>
          <p id="text" class="diet">A diet should not be something you do for 2 months, it should last. Nobody is going to weigh all of their food for the rest of their life either. For this reason, you need to be reasonable with changes to your diet, otherwise you won't stick to it. There are many little changes you can make that will add up over time.<br><br> Here are a few examples: Take away 10%-20% of each meal and replace it with vegtables. Aim to eat less processed food when you can, the less ingreedients the better. Try to eat foods higher in protein to keep you full. Understand that the fats and oils you add to food, such as cooking something in oil, has alot of calories. Try to drink more water, only drink alchohol socially.<br><br>There are many small tweaks that can be made that will add up over time, pick a few that you think you can stick too, if you fail once or twice dont give up completely. </p>
